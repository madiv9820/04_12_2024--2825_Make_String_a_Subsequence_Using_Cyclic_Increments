- ## Approach 2:- Two Pointers using Iteration

    - ### Intuition:
        The problem is to check whether we can transform `str1` into `str2` by performing a sequence of operations. Specifically, for each character in `str1`, we can either:
        1. Match it directly with the corresponding character in `str2`.
        2. Increment the character in `str1` by 1 (i.e., 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', ..., 'z' wraps back to 'a') and match the incremented character with the corresponding character in `str2`.

        To solve this problem, we need to check whether we can traverse through `str1` and match all characters of `str2` by either direct matching or by incrementing characters.

    - ### Approach:
        1. **Two Pointers**: Use two pointers (`index1` and `index2`) to iterate through `str1` and `str2` respectively.
            - `index1` will traverse through each character of `str1`.
            - `index2` will track which character in `str2` we are currently trying to match.
        2. **Character Matching**:
            - If `str1[index1]` matches `str2[index2]`, increment `index2` to move to the next character in `str2`.
            - If `str1[index1]` doesn't match `str2[index2]`, increment the character in `str1` by one (i.e., move from 'a' to 'b', 'b' to 'c', etc.) and check if it matches `str2[index2]`. If it matches, increment `index2`.
        3. **Termination Condition**:
            - If `index2` reaches the end of `str2`, it means we've successfully matched all characters of `str2` in `str1`, so return `true`.
            - If we finish iterating through `str1` without fully matching `str2`, return `false`.
        4. **Final Check**: After the loop ends, if we have matched all characters of `str2` (i.e., `index2 == str2_length`), return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

    - ### Time Complexity:
        - **O(str1_length)**: We only traverse through `str1` once. Each character comparison or increment operation takes constant time, and `index1` is incremented with each iteration.
        - In the worst case, we will traverse all characters of `str1` and potentially check multiple increments, but the total number of steps depends directly on the length of `str1`, so the overall time complexity is **O(str1_length)**.

    - ### Space Complexity:
        - **O(1)**: We are using only a few integer variables (`index1`, `index2`, `str1_Length`, `str2_Length`), so the space complexity is constant. No additional data structures are used, and the space does not depend on the input size.
